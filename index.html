  <p>My name is Kate.  I am a retired Software Engineer with 20 years of experience in the field.  I love
    tech, and would love to re-enter the field in a new and exciting way.
  </p>
  <p>I'm married with two great kids who are embarking on their own careers in the sciences.  I live in
    Fullerton, California, but am moving soon to the Seattle area for my next big adventure.
